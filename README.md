# picture-show2
picture-show2 is a simple but elegant desktop application to present your photos. It uses full screen resolution, enables different animation effects and has an automatic timer function to advance to the next photo. No pre-rendering is necessary, start the application and you're good to go.

Choose a folder of pictures, specify the display properties and the picture-show begins. In fullscreen mode the software is keyboard-controlled during a picture show. The mouse pointer interferes with the appeal of a photo presentation and is hidden once a directory has been chosen.

## Dependencies
- picture-show2 is build using C++ and QML using the Qt-Framework with QtQuick
- It can easily be build with QtCreator and qmake (project file included)

<h1>picture show 2 - help</h1>
</center>

<p>
picture show 2 is a simple but elegant application to present your photos. Fullscreen
resolution is supported with different transition effects between the images. No pre-rendering
is required, just select a folder and start the show...
You can advance to the next image manually or by the use of an automatic timer function. Both
modes can be combined.
</p>

<p>
Your pictures are in the main focus of the application. Except for the folder containing the your
pictures you can specify a couple of settings related to the presentation, like the transition time and
effect as well as sorting and control options.
In fullscreen mode the mouse cursor is hidden so it doesn't interfere with the picture presentation.
Overlays are not shown unasked. Use the keyboard to control advancing and additional functions or
the mouse buttons if activated in the options.

<table>
<tr><td width="120">H</td><td>A summary of the most important controls is shown.</td></tr>

the new picture hit ENTER. A preview of the image is shown as soon as the target has been loaded.</td></tr>

<h2>Open Dialog / Settings</h2>
</center>
<p>
The open Dialog and Settings Dialog provides the configuration for picture-show. Two modes are available to open pictures. Single Folder
mode and Drag and Drop mode. Settings are devided in presentation options and miscellaneous options on two different tabs. If the dialog
is accepted with OK a new show is loaded or all changes are applied to the current show. In the following the functionality is described
in detail.
</p>
<center>
<table>
<tr><td width="150">Folder mode tab</td><td>
A folder can be specified to look for pictures to be shown in the picture show. All images of type jpg/jpeg, tif/tiff, gif and png are
supported. Additionally, subfolders can be included in the search.</td></tr>
<tr><td width="150">Drag and Drop mode tab</td><td>
Pictures and folders can be dragged and dropped to the dialog. Pictures are directly added to the current selection, folders are
recursively searched for pictures and added as well. Depending on the amount of data to be processed, this may take a few moments.
The current Drop Zone can be cleared with Empty Drop Zone Button. It is also possible to save the current Zone (with Save collection
button) to a collection. Dropped pictures are saved directly in the collection, dropped folders are saved as Smart Folders. That means
that when loading the collection later (with Load collection button) the folder is read in again looking for new or also obsolete pictures.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fading effect</td><td>Choose the fading effect to be used to switch between pictures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Übergangszeit</td><td>Choose the fading time to be used for switching pictures. The duration is effect dependend and can be choosen
between very fast and slow.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Sorting</td><td>The sorting specifies the order in which the pictures appear in the show. You can choose between alphabetical order
 of the filenames or chronological order of the date taken. Therefore, the date taken has to be present in the EXIF information of the
 pictures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Scale</td><td>The scale specifies wheather to show whole pictures or fill the screen. Whole pictures will leave blank space right
and left or on top and bottom, respectively. The fill screen option crops the pictures maintaining aspect ratio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Loop slide show</td><td>If activated, advancing to the next picture from the last will end up at the first picture in the show.
If the show is at the first picture and the previous picture is requested, it will end up showing the last picture in the show.
This option is also effective when using the automatic timer function.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mouse control</td><td>If activated, pictures can be switched with left and right mouse button. The middle mouse button can be used
to open the Open/Settings Dialog. The scroll whell can be used to activate the jump-function and to switch through the pictures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Language</td><td>Specifies the language.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Background color</td><td>Specifies the background color to be used in the show.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Update notification</td><td>If activated, the application shows a notice in the Open/Settings dialog about new versions. A link is
displayed to download an installation package.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cache size</td><td>The size of memory to be used to temporarily cache pictures additionally to the current picture and the memory
which is used by the application itself. Choose between 150 MB and 400 MB for smooth transition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Save history</td><td>If activated, folders which have been opened in the Folder mode are saved and can be chosen in the drop down
list in later sessions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Delete history</td><td>Deletes all folders in the history</td></tr>
